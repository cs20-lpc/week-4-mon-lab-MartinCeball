# Week 4 Mon Lab

## Directions

You will be partially implementing the List ADT as a linked list. The `List` abstract class is already given to you, along with the header file for the `LinkedList` class, and a skeleton of its implementation file. A few operations have been given temporary, empty implementations. We will discuss how to do these in the next lecture.

You are also in charge of writing your own driver program (__Make sure to call your file driver.cpp__) to test your `LinkedList` class. Be thorough with your testing by checking all the operations in different scenarios and with various data types.  

### Submit your test results for various scenarios in Canvas - 10 points for test coverage.
With each test case indicate what scenario you are testing. Just adding similar tests won't count.

## Notes

- If you need to access the `length` attribute in your `LinkedList` class, you need to write it as `this->length`
- All nodes are to be treated as dynamic, meaning you have to use the `new` and `delete` operators with them
    + For example, to create a node, you could do
    ```C++
    Node* myNode = new Node;
    ```
- There are some operations that need to consider if it's invalid for it to be called: in those scenarios, make sure to `throw` a `string` exception explaining the error, like this
```C++
throw string("message goes here");
```
- The `<<` stream insertion operator has been overloaded for the `LinkedList` class, meaning you can use `cout` on your `LinkedList` object to print out the nodes inside
